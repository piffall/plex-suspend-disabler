# plex-suspend-disabler

## The problem

Electricity bill hurts, so I suspend my media server after 15 minutes of
 inactivity. But I have to disable if I want to see a Movie.

## The solution

Run this daemon on your Gnome desktop.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piffall/plex-suspend-disabler.git
cd plex-suspend-disabler
sudo npm install -g
```

## Run

```bash
plex-suspend-disabler YourTokenHere
```

I recomend you to launch at start up.
